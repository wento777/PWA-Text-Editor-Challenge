# Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Challenge: Text Editor


 ## Description 

- This project was designed as a homework assignment for KU coding bootcamp in Module 19 Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Challenge: Text Editor

- 

-  Writing about tech can be just as important as making it.

- 

- Testing is key to making code maintainable, you’ll also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them.


- A major aspect of this challenge was the balance between figuring out which solution made sense and the solution that would be most efficient.

- 

- Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies.

- A simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels.
