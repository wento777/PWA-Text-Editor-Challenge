# Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Challenge: Text Editor


 ## Description 

- This project was designed as a homework assignment for KU coding bootcamp in Module 19 Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Challenge: Text Editor

- As you have progressed through this course, you have put together a number of impressive projects that you can show off to potential employers.

-  Writing about tech can be just as important as making it.

- This project is no exception; in fact, it features some of the most impressive expressions of the concepts you have learned so far.

- Testing is key to making code maintainable, you’ll also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them.

- A major aspect of this challenge was the balance between figuring out which solution made sense and the solution that would be most efficient.

- Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies.

- A simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels.

 ## Installation

  - To run this, if you want to test before you submit, you must do a build first, npm run build, and then do npm run start:dev 
Both are run from the root. The front end is at localhost 3000.

- In order to install inquirer, i used npm i inquirer@8.2.4.

## Usage

  - This Challenge will combine many of the skills you’ve learned over the first ten weeks of this course. To help you get started, we’ve provided some guidelines in addition to the User Story and Acceptance Criteria.
  
  - IndexedDB is a secondary goal of learning in this module, and all it is an expansion of client side storage. Local storage and session storage are quite limited, as you know. IndexedDB allows a more realistic database experience but on the front end. 

  - Deploy to Heroku as per usual. 

  -  To build this text editor, you will start with an existing application and implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. You will use a package called idb, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. It features a number of methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data, and is used by companies like Google and Mozilla.

  -  Make sure to clone the starter code repository and make your own repository with the starter code. Do not fork the starter code repository!

  - Make sure that you remove dist from the .gitignore file so that Git will track this folder and include it when you push up to your application's repository.
  




## User Story

AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use


## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a text editor web application
WHEN I open my application in my editor
THEN I should see a client server folder structure
WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client
WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
WHEN I run my webpack plugins
THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
WHEN I open the text editor
THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
WHEN I click on the Install button
THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
WHEN I load my web application
THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox
WHEN I register a service worker
THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
WHEN I deploy to Heroku
THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application


 ## Contribute 

 - Make sure to clone the starter code repository and make your own repository with the starter code. Do not fork the starter code repository!
 
 - Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers or other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.


## Tests

  - This application will be tested in Insomnia.
  
  - The front end is at localhost 3000.

## Summary

Progressive Web Apps are web applications that work like mobile apps. They include apps that work offline, apps that load faster due to caching, apps that install on the machine like a mobile app, and apps that have a second thread called a service worker taking care of certain chores in parallel with the javascript code. Push notifications and caching are common service worker jobs. This is kind of a niche area of coding, hasn't been around long, and is just now beginning to pick up a bit of steam among the tech giants, like YT and FB. For this reason, your time is probably better spent on catching up with previous material and perhaps giving yourself a sneak peek of ReactJS.
